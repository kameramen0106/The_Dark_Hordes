Writing up a rought draft of the storyline here.

Setting: around 1100 YW, currently placed in the northwestern parts in and out
 of wesnoth. (or that's where it starts)

Crelanu's Book is introduced by Legend of Wesmere, given to Delfador in 
Delfador's Memoirs, where it is hinted Asheviere took it for a while.
The storytxt of "Crelanu's Book" implies that Ravanal turned to evil after
perusing the book.

Part 1 name: something with escaping and running (Escape the Living?)
Part 2 name: something with striking back at wesnoth (The Death March?)

Scenario 9 (Underground River) outline:
-During the scenario, the cave gets re-flooded by magical means. (drowning!)
-Naga swim around in the water, trying to claim the cave.
-The dwarves that haven't run from the floods yet have no intention of leaving.
    (say they're in a small part of the cave that is separated by chasm)
-Plenty of other annoying things.

gwiti studies the book for a while

*** Split between campaign parts here (09x) ***

Scenarios 10-11 gwiti goes north to find the other half of the skull. Takes
 restless orcs with him. From this moment Tanar can die; getting him killed
causes immediate succession by someone hostile to you.
-re-encounter with leganoth
-using powers from the tome for the first time <- recruit ghouls
In scenario 11, Gwiti retrieves the other half of the Skull of Morgorath,
 at first it is simply an artifact of great power.

... Tanar is left north to gather more orcish forces

Scenario 12: After retrieving the Skull, Gwiti moves to strike at
wesnoth. Remembering his fight with Aretu, he decides to first get rid of the
High Council of Arch Magi in Alduin.
-Approach: gwiti's army sails to the western shore of the island, gwiti and
 skeletons wade to shore under cover of darkness. Rest of army needs to arrive
by ship. No recruiting until you capture a keep.
-Suprise: the magi don't react until their first attack (assassinations work)
-Map: possibly a rework of HttT3 (half a millennium later, changes are fine)
-Story: some aren't there or are hidden, the survivors send Elynia after Gwiti

...
Scenario 13: Landfall
Gwiti crushes an unprepared Aldril.
...
Scenario 14: Ambush
An elvish force lead by Elynia launches a surprise attack at Gwiti near the
crossroads.
...
Scenario 15: The Crown Prince
The crown prince has lead the army to defend Dan'Tonk. Gwiti was originally
planning to either sack the city if it was weakly defended, or simply bypass
it if it had good defenses, but with the entire Wesnothian army camped out,
Weldyn will have to wait.

After dusk, Gwiti blackens the sky and announces that they will never see the
sun again.

When Gwiti has defeated part of the army (or if he takes too long...),
Morgorath awakens, appropriates some nearby bones, raises an army of his own
and faces off against Gwiti. The Crown Prince wisely draws back his forces into
the city.
Morgorath takes control of more undead every turn.
...
Weakened, Gwiti flees northeast.

...
Scenario 16: Glyn's Forest
Meetup with invading orcs. The orcs are not united, but attracted by the
prospect of easy conquest. When they find undead being pursued by humans,
everyone but Tanar (if alive) turns on the undead.

Gwiti successfully escapes eastward.

*** possibly after this campaign ***

Gwiti's death (possible end of the campaign): by the hands of Elynia,
 who later becomes the lady of light.
At the start of the scenario, Elynia says that one of the two must die there.
Gwiti replies that one will indeed die, and the other will live forever.

When Elynia kills Gwiti, (how to write that into this campaign I don't know)
 he stays true to his word and curses Elynia:
    to live until no living things remain
