# The Dark Hordes
Lead fugitive dark sorcerer Gwiti Haâ€™atel to mastery of the undead hordes. Eleven playable scenarios so far. Originally made by Circon, currently maintained by KameRamen.

Note: I have reset the campaign to its original state once because I made too many major changes. A rework including the previous improvements will be released as The Dark Hordes Revised in the near future.

Edit: Currently available is The Shadow Returns; the complete reworking of this campaign by KameRamen. I recommend playing that for now.
